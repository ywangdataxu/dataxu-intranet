            First goal of this project is to show how simple it is to implement an AngularJS application using Spring
            Boot as a backend,
            and Bootstrap as a CSS framework. It is freely inspired from the ASP.NET Web API example built by Mathieu
            and available
            here: https://github.com/mathieubrun/Samples.AngularBootstrapWebApi.

            Second goal is to show what are the framework and tools that we can use today (in 2014) to create light and
            quick to setup
            web applications in Java. It leverage on Java 8, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Thymleaf and AngularJS.
